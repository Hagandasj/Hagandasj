- 👋 Hi, I’m @Hagandasj
- 👀 I’m interested in data analysis, GUI development, electronics, and programming. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning circuit development and relatively advanced data analysis with Python.
- 💞️ Currently I do not have time to collaborate on any projects, however if you think there are things I would be interested in feel free to send them my way.
- 📫 You can reach me at the following email: hamburger_development@mail.com
